This data can be used to proactively troubleshoot and identify issues as quickly as possible. [Contact Zoom Sales](https://explore.zoom.us/en/contactsales/) to add this feature.\n\n **Requirements**\n\n In addition to having the QSS product on your account, at least one user on the account must have Developer permissions enabled to be able to create an application that can subscribe to QSS events. This user should create a Zoom app to receive notifications.\n\n**Enabling QSS event notifications**\n\nOn the Feature page for the Marketplace app, enable **Event Subscription** and add the **Event notification endpoint URL** to send the webhooks. Click **Add events** and select **QSS**. Select the QSS events that you'd like to receive.\n\nNote that you must subscribe to the QSS summary event to receive data from the QoS summary APIs.","termsOfService":"https://zoom.us/docs/en-us/zoom_api_license_and_tou.html","contact":{"name":"Zoom Developers","url":"https://developer.zoom.us/"},"version":"2"},"externalDocs":{"description":"Find out more about Swagger","url":"https://swagger.io"},"servers":[{"url":"https://api.zoom.us/v2"}],"paths":{"/metrics/meetings/{meetingId}/participants/qos_summary":{"get":{"tags":["Dashboards"],"summary":"List meeting participants QoS Summary","description":"Returns a list of meeting participants from past meetings and the summary of their quality of service received during the meeting.
